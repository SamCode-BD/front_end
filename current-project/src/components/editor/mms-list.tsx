        "The anterior nasal spine is scored progressively as slight, intermediate, and marked.",
        "Inferior nasal aperture (INA) is an assessment of the shape of the inferior border of the nasal aperture just lateral to the anterior nasal spine, which defines the transition from nasal floor to the vertical portion of the maxillae. Bilateral asymmetry may occur. If so, the left side is used. The morphology of INA ranges from an inferior slope with no delineation of the inferior border (1) to a sharp, vertical ridge of bone, or nasal sill (5). ",
        "Interorbital breadth (IOB) is assessed in the following nonmetric forms: narrow, intermediate, and broad. This assessment is made relative to the facial skeleton.",
        "The malar tubercle (MT) is a caudally protruding tubercle located on the inferior margin of the maxilla and zygomatic bone in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture. The presence of malar tubercle is scored by placing a transparent ruler at the intersection of the zygomaticomaxillary suture with the inferior margin of the malar to the deepest point on the curvature of the maxilla. An assessment is then made on the extent of protrusion beyond the ruler's edge. In instances where the suture is directly on the tubercle, the ruler is placed from the deepest curvature of the maxilla to the deepest anterior curvature on the zygomatic. Note: A malar tubercle may be present on the maxilla, the zygomatic, or along the zygomaticomaxillary suture. Observers should not consider the tubercles on the lateral zygomatic arch. A completely absent MT is rare. ",
        "The shape of the nasal aperture (NAS) is assessed by observing 1) the lateral contours of the nasal aperture and, directly related, 2) the position of greatest lateral projection of the margin (teardrop, with lateral projection intermediate to 2 and 3; bell shape, with greatest lateral projection at the inferior margin; and, Bowed, with greatest lateral projection at midline [see red arrows in illustrations]).",
        "The width of the nasal aperture is assessed relative to the facial skeleton. It is scored as narrow, medium, or broad.",
        "Nasal Bone Contour (NBC) is defined as the contour of the midfacial region (particularly the contour of the nasal bones and the frontal process of the maxilla) approximately 1 cm below nasion. Visual interpretation of nasal contour is not the most effective manner of analysis due to high inter- and intra-observer error. The use of a contour gauge permits more reliable and consistent assessment of nasal contour. To assess NBC, the cranium should be placed in a position that allows the observer to gently, but with consistent and balanced pressure, place the contour gauge directly on the nasal bones approximately 1cm inferior to nasion, while maintaining the gauge roughly perpendicular to the palate and parallel to the orbits. Most observations require approximately 20 mm at the deepest point on the contour gauge for proper assessment, although a lower or higher mid-face may require adjustments of this procedure. The contour gauge should be used multiple times to ensure correct assessment. Misalignment of needles may result in incorrect assessment; realign needles after taking each contour. ",
        "Nasal bone shape (NBS) is assessed from the anterior view with the cranium positioned in approximate anatomical position. A determination is made regarding 1) the position of nasal pinch, if any, and 2) the amount of lateral bulging. While making the assessment, the observer should not consider the frontonasal suture, the nasal suture, or the symmetry of the nasal bones. Rather, an assessment is made of the lateral contours of the nasal bones.",
        "Nasal overgrowth (NaOvg) is defined as an inferior projection of the lateral border of the nasal bones beyond the maxillae at nasale inferious. Assessment of nasal overgrowth does not include anterior bulging of the nasal bones. Observations should be made of the left side if it is undamaged. If the left side is damaged, the right side may be substituted. If both nasal bones are missing or fractured (ante-, peri-, or postmortem), leave BLANK. Note: It may be useful to run your finger along the borders of the maxilla and nasal bones near nasale inferious to determine whether a projection is present.",
        "The nasofrontal suture is the suture separating the nasal bones from the frontal bone. The shape of the suture is assessed. Nonmetric variants include: round, square, triangular, and irregular. Assessment is best made from the anterior view. The symmetry of the nasal bones should be ignored. If nasal bones evince extreme pinching of the superior border (as in NBS 4), observation should be left BLANK - unobservable.",
        "Orbital shape includes the following nonmetric variants: Rectangular, Circular, and Rhombic. Observation is best from the anterior view. The shape of the orbit is defined by the orbital margin of the superior, lateral, and inferior borders. The medial border of the orbit is defined by the anterior lacrimal crest and the maxillary process of the frontal bone. Observers should assess whether the margins are anglular (rectangle), curvilinear (circular), or irregular (rhombic). Bilateral asymmetry may occur. All observations should be made from the left orbit.",
        "Post-bregmatic depression is a slight to broad depression along the sagittal suture, posterior to bregma, which is not the result of pathology. Observed in lateral profile, the trait is scored as either absent (no depression) or present. ",
        "The posterior zygomatic tubercle (PoZygT), or the marginal process, is a posterior projection of the zygomatic bone at approximately midorbit as viewed in lateral plane. To observe the various degrees of expression, a small, transparent ruler is placed on the frontal process of the zygomatic from the landmarks frontomalare posterale to jugale. The extent of bony protrusion beyond the ruler's edge is then assessed.",
        "In adult crania, a secondary complex suture may persist, which is generally referred to as the supranasal suture, or sutura supranasalis. This suture does not represent the nasal portion of a persistent metopic suture, which is generally a single, non-oscillating line, but rather is the fusion of the nasal portion of a frontal suture. SPS appears as a complex of interlocking bony spicules at glabella.",
        "The zygomaticomaxillary suture (ZS) is the suture between the maxilla and the zygomatic. The course of the suture is best observed in the anterior view. In instances of asymmetrical manifestations, the left side is preferred. The infraorbital suture should be ignored when making a determination. Assessment of ZS is based primarily on the approximate location of greatest lateral projection of the suture, and also on the number of major angles present. Sutures having greatest lateral projection at the inferior margin, but a slight angle near the midpoint of the suture should be scored as 0.",
        "The course of the transverse palatine suture (TPS) is highly variable, although certain themes persist. TPS is not scored unilaterally, although asymmetrical sutures are not uncommon. The entire suture is observed, but concentrate on the medial one-half in the region of the palatine suture. When an asymmetrical suture is present (the two branches of the suture do not come into contact at midline) the general theme is recorded (e.g., straight, jagged, etc.). Slight undulations of the suture should not be considered when making a determination. If the suture is obliterated, leave BLANK."
